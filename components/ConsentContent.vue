    You have been invited to take part in a research study to learn more
    about the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory, value-based learning,
    and decision-making. This study will be conducted by Marcelo Mattar, FAS
    - Psychology, Arts &amp; Science, New York University
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you agree to be in this study, you will be presented repeatedly
    with images and written words on your computer screen and asked to
    memorize them or to make decisions, responding using key presses or
    mouse clicks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The amount of time to complete the study may vary between 5-90
    minutes, depending on the experimental condition. A more precise time
    estimate is provided on the Prolific flyer. There are no known risks
    associated with your participation in this research beyond those of
    everyday life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For your participation, you will receive the base payment advertised
    on the Prolific flyer. You may additionally receive a bonus payment
    based on the decisions you make in the experiment (the maximum bonus
    is also given on the Prolific flyer). The base payment and
    bonus are determined such that a median (i.e., typical) wage is US$12
    per hour.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If for any reason you do not complete the study (e.g. technical
    difficulties, or a desire to stop), you will receive a pro-rated payment
    based on the amount of the experiment that you completed. Importantly,
    in the event that you do not finish the study, we will only be able to
    provide partial compensation if you send a message through Prolific.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help
    the investigator understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory,
    value-based learning, and decision-making.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will collect your prolific IDs for the purpose of assigning
    performance-dependent bonuses. However, this information will never be
    publicly shared.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anonymized data with identifying information removed may be used in
    future research, shared with other researchers, or placed in a data
    repository without your additional consent.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to
    participate or withdraw at any time without penalty. You have the right
    to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer (with the
    exception of quizzes to ensure the comprehension of instructions).

    unclear or that you do not understand, if you have questions or wish to
